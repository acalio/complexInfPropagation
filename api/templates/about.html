                        To properly capture the complexity of influence propagation phenomena in
                        real-world contexts, such as those related to viral marketing and misinformation
                        spread, information diffusion models should fulfill a number of requirements. <br>

                        These include accounting for several dynamic aspects in the propagation (e.g.,
                        latency, time horizon), dealing with multiple cascades of information that might
                        occur competitively, accounting for the contingencies that lead a user to change
                        her/his adoption of one or alternative information items, and leveraging
                        trust/distrust in the users’ relationships and its effect of influence on the users’
                        decisions. To the best of our knowledge, no diffusion model unifying all of the
                        above requirements has been developed so far. In this work, we address such a
                        challenge and propose a novel class of diffusion models, inspired by the classic
                        linear threshold model, which are designed to deal with trust-aware,
                        non-competitive as well as competitive time-varying propagation scenarios. <br>
                        Our
                        theoretical inspection of the proposed models unveils important findings on the
                        relations with existing linear threshold models for which properties are known
                        about whether monotonicity and submodularity hold for the corresponding
                        activation function. We also propose strategies for the selection of the initial
                        spreaders of the propagation process, for both non-competitive and competitive
                        influence propagation tasks, whose goal is to mimic contexts of misinformation
                        spread. Our extensive experimental evaluation, which was conducted on publicly
                        available networks and included comparison with competing methods, provides
                        evidence on the meaningfulness and uniqueness of our models.

                    <div class="text-muted">
                        Here we introduce our proposed class of models, which is comprised of: the Non-
                        Competitive F 2 DLT (nC-F 2 DLT ), the Semi-Progressive F 2 DLT (spC-F 2 DLT ),
                        and the Non-Progressive F 2 DLT (npC-F 2 DLT). <br>

                        All of the models share some commons aspects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Distinction between trusted connections (positive links) and distrusted connection
                                (negative links)
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Dynamic Behavior</strong>
                                via the definition of an <strong>Activation-threshold function</strong> and
                                a <strong>Quiescence function</strong>.<br>
                                The first one
                                models the tendency of users to increase their belief towards a piece of information
                                which propagates along a network; while the second quantifies the latency in the
                                propagation
                                as function of the number of distrusted neighbors involved in the propagation process.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6 class="card-title">Non-Competitive (nC-F 2 DLT)</h6>
                        The first model, nC-F2-DLT refers to the non-competing environment, i.e.,
                        a scenario where there is only a single campaign propagating along the network. <br>
                        Each node in the network will go through the following life-cycle:
                        <div class="card-post__image"
                             style="background-image: url('/static/img/noncom.png');background-size:40% 80%;"></div>
                    </div>

                    <h6 class="card-title">Semi-Progressive (spC-F 2 DLT)</h6>
                    The second model adheres the scenario where two competing campaigns are spreading simultaneously
                    along
                    the network. We will refer to these campaigns as the &ldquo; Good &rdquo; and the
                    &ldquo; Bad &rdquo; campaign. <br>
                    In this context, a node can be either active in favor of the good campaign or the other. <br>
                    Also, once a node becomes active it is allowed to switch its activation state from one campaign to
                    the
                    opposite one but it is not allowed to turn back into the inactive state. <br>
                    The following figure represents the life-cycle of a node with respect to the Semi-Progressive model.

                    <div class="card-post__image"
                         style="background-image: url('/static/img/SEMI.png');background-size:23% 90%;"></div>


                    <h6 class="card-title">Non-Progressive (npC-F 2 DLT)</h6>
                    This model refers to the same competing environment as the previous diffusion model. <br>
                    However, unlike the Semi-Progressive model, in this case a node is also allowed to
                    turn back to the inactive state if, after its activation, none of the competing campign
                    is still able to maintain its activation, i.e., neither one of the two campaigns is able
                    to exert an amount of influence greater or equal to the node's activation threshold. <br>

                    The following figure represents the life-cycle of a node with respect to the Non-Progressive Mode.
